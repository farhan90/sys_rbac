This is the documentation for SBRACK project

DESIGN
------
Since the project was an open ended project with no specification,I decided
to implement a very simple role based access model using Linux Security Model
framework. 

In my role based access model I first had to idenitfy the tasks which could
be performed on the file system. I decided to have simple tasks or operations
like reading,writing,renaming or creating or deleting a file. So i decided to 
have 3 main ops which are READ, RDWR, CRTDEL. 

The READ task or op only allows a user to read a file
The RDWR task allows someone to read a file, write to a file
The CRTDEL tasks allows someone to read,write, create,delete or rename a file

So any role can be assigned any of these 3 tasks, which can be performed by
the users of that role.
